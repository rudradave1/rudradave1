Rudra Dave

Senior Android Engineer specializing in Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and scalable mobile architecture.

I build production-grade Android applications with a focus on reliability, offline-first data systems, and long-term maintainability.

What I Focus On

Clean Architecture & modular multi-module codebases

Jetpack Compose UI systems (Material 3)

Room as single source of truth

Background sync with WorkManager

Coroutines + Flow state management

Testable ViewModels and repository layers

Production Experience

Currently contributing to a fintech Android product where I work across:

Feature development (payments, dashboards, onboarding flows)

Architecture decisions and modularization

Crash monitoring and performance optimization

Release ownership and iterative product improvements

Selected Projects
Compose Production Template

Production-ready Android template demonstrating Clean Architecture, Compose, Hilt, Room (offline-first), Retrofit, WorkManager sync, and ViewModel test coverage.

CareLog

Offline-first Android architecture showcase app with conflict-safe background synchronization and modular structure.

I prefer building systems that are simple on the surface, but engineered thoughtfully underneath.
