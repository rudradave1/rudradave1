👋 Hi, I’m Rudra Dave

I’m an Android developer focused on building reliable, production-quality apps using modern Android architecture.

I care about:
- Offline-first design and data consistency
- Jetpack Compose UI that is clean, accessible, and maintainable
- Scalable app architecture (Room, WorkManager, background sync)
- Writing code that is easy to reason about and evolve

Currently:
- Working primarily with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose
- Deepening expertise in Android architecture and system design
- Building portfolio projects that reflect real-world production challenges

Projects:
- **CareLog** — Offline-first Android app with Room as source of truth, background sync, and conflict resolution
- **Aura RNG** — Minimalist game exploring randomness, progression, and player feedback loops

I enjoy building things that are simple on the surface, but thoughtfully engineered underneath.
